# Summary and Reflection on The Gaming Room Project
## Client and Software Requirements:
The Gaming Room was the client, and they needed a software application designed for a game called "Draw It or Lose It." The client required the game to support multiple teams, ensure unique identifiers for each game, team, and player, and be capable of running on a web-based platform with scalability and security.

## Strengths in Documentation Development:
One aspect I did particularly well was creating clear and detailed documentation that outlined the software requirements and design constraints effectively. This included ensuring that the user’s needs were central to the design process, which helped in translating their requirements into actionable development steps.

## Helpful Aspects of the Design Document Process:
Working through the design document was instrumental in developing the code, as it provided a structured roadmap that clarified the software's architecture before actual coding began. This process helped identify potential challenges early on and ensured that the design was aligned with the client’s needs.

## Areas for Revision:
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the initial requirements gathering process. I would improve it by conducting more in-depth interviews with the client to ensure all potential use cases and edge cases were considered, which would lead to a more comprehensive design document.

## Interpreting User Needs:
I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing their requirements and incorporating them into the software design, ensuring that all necessary features were included and functioned as intended. Considering the user’s needs is crucial because it ensures that the final product meets their expectations and provides a seamless user experience.

## Approach to Software Design:
My approach to designing software involved a combination of careful planning, iterative development, and constant communication with the client to ensure alignment with their vision. In the future, I would continue to use these strategies, along with incorporating more user feedback early in the design process to further refine the software application’s usability and functionality.
